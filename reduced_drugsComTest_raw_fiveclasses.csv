163740,Mirtazapine,Depression,"""I&#039;ve tried a few antidepressants over the years (citalopram, fluoxetine, amitriptyline), but none of those helped with my depression, insomnia &amp; anxiety. My doctor suggested and changed me onto 45mg mirtazapine and this medicine has saved my life. Thankfully I have had no side effects especially the most common - weight gain, I&#039;ve actually lost alot of weight. I still have suicidal thoughts but mirtazapine has saved me.""",10,28-Feb-12,22
97768,Cyclafem 1 / 35,Birth Control,"""I have been on this birth control for one cycle. After reading some of the reviews on this type and similar birth controls I was a bit apprehensive to start. Im giving this birth control a 9 out of 10 as I have not been on it long enough for a 10. So far I love this birth control! My side effects have been so minimal its like Im not even on birth control! I have experienced mild headaches here and there and some nausea but other than that ive been feeling great! I got my period on cue on the third day of the inactive pills and I had no idea it was coming because I had zero pms! My period was very light and I barely had any cramping! I had unprotected sex the first month and obviously didn&#039;t get pregnant so I&#039;m very pleased! Highly recommend""",9,22-Oct-15,4
215892,Copper,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had the copper coil for about 3 months now. I was really excited at the thought of not taking hormones. I&#039;m good with pain however I nearly fainted with insertion, couldn&#039;t belive how painful it was; the doctor did say it is very painful for some. Well 3 months in, my periods last 11 days and I&#039;m in pain for about 15 days with random twangs especially in the left side and I&#039;m considering whether I want to put up with the intense pain and heavy periods. I&#039;d recommend this 100% to somebody who doesn&#039;t already have heavy painful periods but right now it just isn&#039;t for me""",6,6-Jun-16,1
71428,Levora,Birth Control,"""I was on this pill for almost two years. It does work as far as not getting pregnant however my experience at first was it didn&#039;t make a huge difference then 6 or 7 months into it my sex drive went down, along with being very very dry, my moodiness increased drastically. I would cry one second and then get angry with my husband over anything and everything. My skin has gotten a lot worse, I broke out in places I never had in the last week. So now I am on Yaz.""",2,16-Apr-11,3
33173,Microgestin Fe 1 / 20,Acne,"""So I was on Ginanvi for about 3 months before I switched over to this pill due to the high cost of Ginavi (I don&#039;t have insurance). Ginanvi had cleared up my acne in the short time I used and I was hoping this birth control would not mess that up. I was wrong. After 2-3 months of using this pill my skin went crazy with horrible breakouts. Now, 9 months later I still have horrible acne. If you want a pill that helps with acne this is NOT it. It also made my period &quot;weird&quot;. I would have little to no period one month and a heavy one the next . The month that I had a heavier flow my boobs would hurt a lot. I also noticed that at the beginning of taking it , I would be moody and extremely irritable all the time . It&#039;s time for me to switch.""",3,22-Jun-17,1
79865,Blisovi Fe 1 / 20,Birth Control,"""I absolutely love this product and recommend to everyone. I know everyone&#039;s body is different, so it is not for everyone, but it is not the medicines fault. I have NO negative symptoms since I started this. I used to have heavy periods, terrible cramps and headaches, and my periods were super long. I now have super consistent 3-4 LIGHT periods, no cramps or headaches. I have been on this pill for over a year now and have no desire to switch.""",10,3-Nov-17,4
178004,Duloxetine,Pain,"""Been on 30mg Cymbalta for 2 weeks. Started getting relief by the 2nd day. Am 58 year old male with spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease, and spondy. Plan was to go to 60mg but I am getting enough relief at 30mg. I believe I will try to stay on that dose to minimize side effects. Some constipation, difficult reaching orgasm, some night sweats and minor headaches. Oh, insomnia if I took it at night.  I had samples of this medicine for 6 months but delayed starting it because of horror stories on the internet. Pain was ruining my life so this medicine seems to be the best option.""",9,27-Mar-12,32
60341,NuvaRing,Birth Control,"""I was on this for 5 years (and birth control pills for about 12 years), and would have told you how fabulous it was.  &lt;List all the benefits everyone else has listed, here.&gt;  Then a friend of mine convinced me to stop birth control all together for a while, and I turned into a new and better person!  I dropped 5 lbs instantly, had a huge sex drive, more lubrication, and just felt better.  I wouldn&#039;t say I was depressed before, but after going off of it, I would describe my time on birth control as feeling like I was inside a cloud.  Less emotions in general, sometimes a little down.  I&#039;m bummed I&#039;m back on it, but it seems to be the least impactful than the others.  I might try Paragard to avoid the hormones.""",7,17-Jun-11,0
141462,Escitalopram,Depression,"""I am a 22 year old female college student. I wanted to write this because when I was at my lowest of low when I felt absolutely hopeless... these positive reviews are what got me through the day. I experienced a lot of change.  I was also in a relationship that made me unhappy. I stopped doing the things I liked to do such as run, party, work, hang out with friends etc. In result, I never had energy. I constantly felt guilty. I cried everyday, sometimes multiple times of day. I went to group therapy. I dropped 10lbs in two weeks. I eventually got on this medicine &amp; the first 4 days felt crazy &amp; tired! TAKE AT NIGHT. Give this medicine time! Now 3 weeks in I am back to myself and am truly happy!

I&#039;m moody, irritable, depressed, hungry, bitchy... vaginal discharge has changed  (gross), my urine smells, my acne has gotten so out of hand and it&#039;s STUBBORN. Cystic acne all around my mouth, jawline, Chin and neck. After doing some research online, I discovered I&#039;m not the only one. Birth control is different for everyone but this is going in the trash... I will not be taking this any longer. It also kills your sex drive... as for the difference in bleeding, I wouldn&#039;t know. I started this pill on day 1 of menstrual cycle last month and haven&#039;t had a period yet... have had plenty of headaches though! """,1,13-Dec-15,6
17957,Ethinyl estradiol / etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I started on the oral contraceptive pill but got horrible nausea and vomiting, so this was my next option. NuvaRing has been fantastic, it has a fraction of the hormones and I get no nausea. Insertion and removing is really not a hassle, and you cannot feel it at all. For me, it beats the pill and vomiting, along with all the other symptoms. I haven&#039;t had any noticeable mood issues or migraines. I would recommend it to anyone!""",10,13-Dec-12,4
219567,Microgestin Fe 1.5 / 30,Birth Control,"""About two months ago I had to switch from LoLestrin Fe to microgestin due to my insurance and pharmacy. Since starting microgestin I&#039;ve noticed insane bloating and nausea and weird discharge. While on lolestrin, my periods consisted of spotting and average side effects, nothing too serious, but after one month of micro I got my period and it was heavy and the cramping was so painful I had to leave my class. I&#039;ve also noticed I&#039;ve developed bad depression and my mood swings are very intense. My anxiety is bad and my sex drive is very low if not nonexistent anymore. It helped with my acne but I&#039;m a lot more paranoid about getting pregnant than I was on lolestrin. I&#039;m going to be talking to my doctor about possibly getting the shot.""",1,31-Oct-16,4

202002,Benzoyl peroxide / clindamycin,Acne,"""My GP had prescribed this to me at my requests for something to deal with my acne. I used this medication for about a month or a little longer. This medication dries out my face something terrible. I had to slather moisturizer on my face, which was probably counterintuitive. The medication worked well at drying out existing acne on my face but did nothing to prevent new acne. Every day I would wake up to new zits. I ended up going to a dermatologist and had something else prescribed. 

Also, with this medication containing benzoyl peroxide it stains your sheets very badly (thankfully, I already had a pillow case that resisted staining, same can&#039;t be said for the sheets).""",4,26-Jan-17,2
143003,Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had this birth control for a year now and at first things were going good, I only had a period once and never had one since but now I have super bad anxiety, I would constantly think I was pregnant, would waste my money on pregnancy test even though I am NOT pregnant and my depression was very bad and honestly , I really don&#039;t think it&#039;s worth it at all.

Then my period started coming twice a month with horrific cramps. Or I would spot for 2-3 weeks have a week where I thought It was over and started spotting again. I&#039;ve now had it for 13 months and it does the job because I havent gotten pregnant. But that&#039;s only because I haven&#039;t been able to have sex cause I don&#039;t know when my period is going to come""",5,28-Aug-15,7
190325,Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo,Birth Control,"""I started off by taking regular Ortho Tri Cyclen, which helped some with my acne, but I also became severely depressed, so I went off it.  After a year and a half of not taking birth control at all, I began taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo for acne, and after 4 months my skin is MUCH clearer.  If I do get pimples, they are much smaller and more shallow than before, and go away quicker.  I am pleased!""",9,23-Dec-13,7

Finally my Dr put me on this, benzol peroxide 5% and Retinal- A.

124544,Skyla,Birth Control,"""honestly the measurement hurt more than the actual placement! And I&#039;m so happy I went through with it!!! I wish I didn&#039;t read all of these reviews before I did it. Pain is subjective and its not that bad. They explained the procedure to me and I felt more comfortable. I&#039;ve never had kids. Its just like getting a regular pap. I think it is the best option of birth control. That being said I will definitely recommend getting this! Do expect cramping for a day or two. I didnt cramp until about three hours after having it done. I took ibuprophen and slept with a heating bad. Very mild cramping today but I am happy with my choice :)""",10,14-Jul-15,3
131523,Effexor XR,Anxiety,"""I was prescribed this for onset of anxiety and possible hormonal mood swings. I was not told by my doctor how it would make me feel or how hard coming off of it would be. I took one 37.5 mg capsule and was horrified that I was given this. I woke up at 2am with an anxiety attack for about the first hour. It then went into being wired, nauseous, shakey, weak, chills and sweating. 11 years ago I quit using meth and this was awful that I felt like I was on it again. I laid in bed the entire day, wide awake and ill. I never took another dose! And even one pill took at least another full day to leave my system. My nervous system is obviously sensitive and I could not handle this medication at all.""",2,27-Aug-17,13

Within 10 hours of the first dose I had severe anxiety - something I had never experienced before. Within hours of second dose the extreme nausea came on. By day 3 I was pratically bed-ridden in cold sweats and feeling completely &quot;out of it&quot; . I persevered hoping the effects would begin to subside but by the 5th day I had severe nausea, couldn&#039;t get out of bed from feeling so sick, horrible tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and felt spaced out to the point that I began to wonder if I would ever feel &quot;normal&quot; again.

Once I got to 75mg, I started becoming angry, even more anxious than I was before, I had an out-of-body experience, and I was becoming incredibly impulsive.

As soon as I stopped when my son was 12 mos old, I guess the hormones in my body changed and reacted differently with the shot. I started bleeding for weeks at a time.

Persistent usage of this antibotic is imperative for skin clarity. I noticed no improvement in my skin color/inflamatory symptoms until after a month of usage.

However my psychiatrist put me on klonopin to help ease the anxiety and it has been amazing. I only need .25 mg 2 to 3 times a day, but it gave me the ability to function.

The rapidity of action is due to the unique way it works; it isn&#039;t the typical antidepressant.

Wellbutrin has side effects, but none harsh enough to stop me from taking it regular. The side effects I experience is (a.) a tense feeling (physically), and (b.) kind of a &#039;chemical taste&#039; in my mouth.

Would bleed for a week, stop for 1 day or 2, then start again and it&#039;s been like this since, very dark blood but very light but it&#039;s more than spotting. NOW - I&#039;m very irritable, still losing hair, losing weight, no sex drive, can&#039;t sleep much at all, basically losing faith! No sex really bothers me!!""",5,19-Dec-15,8

I am in the military and deploying without having to worry about taking along 6 months worth of birth control and menstruation products is a HUGE relief.  I had some cramping after the insertion but took two OTC pain relievers and haven&#039;t felt anything since.  I&#039;ve run miles with it in, I&#039;ve done push-ups and sit-ups and not felt a thing.

Mind you before having him my periods were &quot;normal.&quot; After having him, my period was EXTREMELY heavy lasting 5 to 7 days. I was going through 3 and 4 super pads WITH super tampons. I used with it each day until the last day. It was horrible! That lasted for a year because I breastfed.

Sometimes the med &quot;runs out&quot; in the afternoon and you can kind of feel the let down. It works great for depression and would be good if used by itself for weight loss.

The only side effect I sometimes get is dry mouth, so make sure to drink plenty of water if that happens to you. Biotene mouthwash also helps with that.

I&#039;ve gained probably 30 lbs since I had it put in in January 2014. I&#039;m moody and have no sex drive. I exercise regularly and eat fairly well. I keep gaining weight and I hate it.

I also suffer from PCOS and saw dramatic improvement with my periods. They became lighter and always on their time, whereas before the pill I used to bleed 2-3 times per month. However, this pill is not a panacea and it is definitely not harmless. My libido has reduced, I  too experience the occasional paranoia and extreme irritability, my cholesterol and triglycerides have risen although I follow a balanced diet and exercise but I did not gain any weight.

I had little to no acne before taking it, and I have noticed I only get a few pimples here and there, my sex drive has not changed at all still pretty good.

The NuvaRing was great for my skin and regulating and shortening my periods but oh my god did it ever mess me up mentally. I was tired all the time, so moody and depressed, made me feel suicidal and unhappy all the time so thats why I switched.

My anxiety and depression were vastly improved within that 2-4 week window and I began to feel like my old self.

I tried using supplements as recommended by  Julia Ross in her book The Mood Cure, but they were not effective for me.  My depression became so severe last Oct. that I had to go back on to an anti-depressant (Bupropion) but this medication made my depression much worse.  I was then put onto Trintellix in April.  The Trintellix was helpful, but side effects soon began to appear.  

I happened upon an article about a psychiatrist who had used niacin for treating depression.   When I googled niacin and depression, I came upon many other blogs and comments from other people who also found niacin to be effective against their struggles with depression. 

 I was desperate to find an alternative to taking anti-depressants, so 4 weeks ago, I began supplementing with niacin plus vitamin C.   (I had already been taking a vitamin B multi, magnesium, fish oil and Vit. D).  I started with 100mcg niacin and have been gradually increasing the dose by 25mcg increments each day.  I use only the regular niacin, not the timed release nor the non-flushing type.

Since I started taking the additional niacin &amp; vitamin C,  I find that my depression is/has diminished significantly.

Methadone is NOT a treatment of substance abuse, but a tool to aid in the treatment of substance abuse. It does not cure withdrawal, it stops withdrawal symptoms when at a therapeutic level. You will experience withdrawal symptoms when methadone is tapered or discontinued. Those using methadone for substance abuse tend to treat methadone in similar ways as a street drug.

Well, after two weeks on 100 ML, I realized I was feeling better. I would go minutes without thinking negatively, then I would go hours, then full days. It feels SO good to feel like myself again.

The convenience and success I have had may be the same for you or you may have it worse off. Don&#039;t let negative reviews deter you if you are interest - if your insurance covers it (mine did completely) then what is the hurt in giving it a try?""",9,1-Mar-11,3

It is not bothersome and I only notice it it complete silence. On the plus side is virtually a new outlook on life, absence of any sad or hopeless feelings, reduced anxiety, tons of all day energy, focus, and enthusiasm, increased libido, desired weight loss and a shift in personality.

Crackers did seem to help though, if you get this side effect treat it as if you had morning sickness. I also take my pills at night instead of the morning. There were also some days I was a total b!tch, but that could also just be my personality. As for weight gain, absolutely NONE. In fact, I lost weight when I watched my calories and exercised, so the pills had no effect on my metabolism.

Upon resuming, in the 1st month I had NO significant change in acne or facial hair.  The second month, slight  breast tenderness and, my face was less oily.  Breakouts are LESS but not gone yet.  There is less facial hair.    Into month 3, breast tenderness is gone and improvements in skin and hair continue.  This pill is great for women with PCOS like myself.

The only downfall I ever experienced with it was the withdrawal effects if I forgot a dose.  Brain zaps, nausea, general ill feeling.  If one takes it as directed, however, they shouldn&#039;t experience these.

Never quit this medicine on your own without talking to your doctor.""",8,3-May-14,93

For the next 5 wks I had these symptoms with the only change being the severity of the headache from low grade to migraine and as the duration increased I became moody and extremely depressed, I could barely function.

This medication takes sometime to kick in to full effect and many people stop taking after they feel nothing the first week or so. That is a big mistake, if you wait the full 6 weeks you will see such a difference that it will amaze you. The way it builds in the system and it&#039;s afterlife is why it takes a while to get to optimal serum levels in the blood stream. I have battled severe depression and suicidal ideation for over 25 years now. This medication Prozac 40 mg along with Ablify 10mg have solved most of those issues.

It can make you Moody or not. IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE PERSON. For me I had no issues. August 2017 will be three years and I still have yet to get pregnant on this birth control.

I apply retinoid, let it sink in and then I apply Epiduo on those areas. I think it&#039;s important to use it as spot treatment if you&#039;re overly sensitive like me.

An hour after the 20mg pill, my heart was pounding hard, short of breath, which progressed to severe abdominal pain, nausea, the worst pain of my life (easily 2-3x my very worst days with stage 3 adhesive arachnoiditis, Ehlers-Danlos, and innumerable tarlov cysts on my spinal cord), joint pain, muscle pain and spasms, and I could literally feel my CSF pulsing in my spinal cord.

This way sex life is not hampered by the Duloxetine. There is initially a period of adjusting to meds, weight gain, but I have so much more energy to exercise so I&#039;m fit now. Well recommended.

I have since upped my dose to the 1mg Xanax XR twice daily if I need it, but some days I only take one pill to get me through the day and deal with the anxiety at night since I&#039;m home and then take a pill in the morning like normal.

I talked to my dermatologist and she prescribed me a coated tablet, which was significantly easier to digest. Down side: the coated tablet was much more expensive, even with good insurance. With the coated tablet, I notice no negative side-effects. This medication works fast. As soon as I would begin taking it for 5-7 days straight, I would notice a difference in my face, fewer new breakouts. As soon as I stopped, however, the breakouts would begin to slowly appear again.""",8,23-Jan-14,8

I felt like I was going to die, with major brain zaps and horrible migraines being consistent for a week. I also gained 15 pounds in what seemed like a few days.  It&#039;s now been a month since I&#039;ve been off of this awful drug, and I still have brain zaps, and the weight gain too.""",2,3-May-15,32

My breathing is all over the place now when I exercise, I feel nauseous and want to vomit most of the time and now I&#039;m getting anxiety from all of this.

I do use the Klonopin only when I&#039;m in a situation that I need help relaxing. I know I need it at those times. When I take it, I would feel great. If I didn&#039;t need it but thought I did, all it would do is make me tired. It&#039;s been 3 years of PRN Klonopin &amp; I know when I need it and when I don&#039;t.

I got terrible acne all along my jawline &amp; back. Extremely low sex drive &amp; I was so emotionless I felt like a robot. I was on the IUD for about 7 months then decided I couldn&#039;t handle these issues anymore.

Within days I was depressed and miserable, with crying spells. It took me a while to put 2 and 2 together and consider the medicine as a likely cause. I dropped the dose down again and I quickly improved. However, I feel the damage was done and I gradually became more and more depressed and ultimately was taken of the medicine.

For the 6 months I&#039;ve had the nexplanon I bled for 4 out of those 6 months straight. and when I wasn&#039;t bleeding constantly, I would randomly bleed so I constantly had to have a pad for tampon in for 6 months straight.

Took several months. Every step down resulted in above withdrawal symptoms (but worse), and the most horrible part was the restless body (RLS, but all over) at night when trying to sleep.

Sometimes when I move my arm a certain way I feel a slight pinch but I imagine it&#039;ll go away eventually since the area is still sensitive. So far no side effects.

If you don&#039;t have health insurance, I&#039;m sure Planned Parenthood would be able to give you answers. The actual procedure wasn&#039;t painful for me. My doctor injected lidocaine into me cervix (which, surprisingly wasn&#039;t painful). He inserted the IUD, cut the string and was done. There was some pressure when he accidentally tapped the top of my uterus, but otherwise I was fine. Afterward is when it became painful (cramps), but I would just recommend taking Advil.

I do feel tired so I&#039;ve started taking it at night. Also, I feel like I have restless leg syndrome. But other than those things I am now able to focus and my OCD seems to have calmed down a lot.

No dentists knew what to do. I went to my doctor and said I possibly have nerve damage from the numbing shot (I have permanent numbing too).  This medicine has taken away my tingling feeling from the numbing (although it&#039;s still numb, it&#039;s not annoying).  The shooting pain through my jaw is gone and my throbbing is gone too.

That is supposed to be the most painful part so it is worth asking if they can insert without them. If your cervix is positioned in the right way, they should be able to and the insertion will be far less painful! 2) I spotted/bled for about 5 weeks afterward, it was a pain but tolerable. Mild acne and cramps, bloating and some constipation. In fact, this week has been the worst cramping yet, not sure what to think.""",7,29-Jun-17,2

And I haven&#039;t noticed a significant difference in my sex drive, though it has decreased a little - my boyfriend and I have had no problems. I&#039;m glad my body reacted positively to this, because it is a very efficient method of birth control.

I took a year break off of birth control before starting Beyaz.  So far, I have mixed feelings.  I have been feeling panicky, and moody, but again, I&#039;m not sure if that is a product of the birth control, or my GAD.  I also went back on birth control for my skin, because I have bothersome acne.  I have been developing pretty severe headaches, and I have also been feeling nauseous.

I have been using the Inova Pads (BP 4%/Salicylic 2%) for one month. I highly recommend the pads.

The pads are not only great for delvering acne medication, but the pad&#039;s fabric gives you effective and gentle exfoliation. You can see the dead skin on the pads!!! You will be amazed. The excellent exfoliation better aides the Retin-A to be delivered deeper and mroe effetcively. It is a wonderful product. There are some possible, yet very mild side effects. One side effect is that there will be quite a bit of redness. Therefore, there have been times when I have skipped the salicylic morning treatment.""",8,18-Mar-10,0

The only thing I can say was that around the time I got my period, my face was the clearest it ever was and then as soon as my period stopped, I began to breakout again. I think with this birth control I did gain weight, probably around 15-20 pounds. It also made me very moody. I never got so upset/mad as easily as I did when I was on this. I felt like an emotional wreck at times because I would get mad so easily and I hated it.

Also I&#039;ve noticed since switching I&#039;ve been in the &quot;mood&quot; way more. I did gain 5 pounds but no complaints here! I am very thin and the weight has filled out my body! My breasts are so much perkier and larger, which is a plus for me! I also think this made my hair grow. I&#039;ve had a sudden growth in my hair and I have done nothing different to it.

However, after a week or so, the over-drying of my skin subsided. I would actually wake up with really oily skin, and I still do (but that could be from a lot of different things with my skin).

I was awake for 3 days but I did it. I know now that I needed to reduce it a little at a time because I had been taking a high dose for a while.

Since then I&#039;ve started waiting 30min before applying and I definitely don&#039;t rub it off in the shower.

First, Retin A will make the skin soft and susceptible to damage so do not pick skin as it can rip off layers causing scars. I use a sensitive skin soap such as Cetaphil sensitive skin soap. DO NOT scrub your face which stimulates sebum production. Use your finger tips and be as gentle as possible washing face AM/PM daily.
When starting retinoids/ Epiduo, apply at night after washing and let face dry 20min. Apply 50/50 with Cetaphil eczema sensitive skin moisturizer. If you skin is red skip a night but I found that this moisturizer will eliminate the redness. 
Apply moisturizer in the AM after washing/softly drying your face. Use sunscreen""",8,21-Mar-17,10

Yes side effects happen, all birth control has side effects. I spotted a lot the 2nd and 3rd year of the first one I had. Yes mood swings at the end of the 3rd year. I chalk that up to the birth control running out. I would suggest getting it out at least a month before its due to be changed. I waited a week before and the hormones were freaking stupid crazy and I felt pregnant. It all went away when I got the second one put in. 
Overall I love it. It did its job of not letting me have a baby. Not everyone is the same. Try it. If you don&#039;t like it then take it out. Try something else.

This worked a treat, and within 2-3 weeks my skin was looking much better. Over the next 6 months or so, my skin improved and I only had a small break out once in a while.

NOT numb. Positive, happy mostly, tend toward joy. More tolerant and patient too. It did NOT reduce my libido, but DID cause weight gain.  30 pounds since 08 without changing my very healthy moderate diet. Weight won&#039;t budge, unusual for me.

Before drifting off to sleep, I glanced at the clock. It was approx. 2300 hrs. I had an odd feeling in my throat that was possibly closing up. I remember worrying what is going on here? As the feeling in my throat persisted, I also felt my &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s apple&rdquo; fluttering and an elevated heart rate. I soon fell asleep. No other meds taken except for Atorvastatin.

As the morning continued on at 0630, the side effects were evident:
1.	&ldquo;Hot flashes&rdquo; Absolutely miserable. Could not get / stay comfortable. Firstly, had the flushing sweats, then I would get too cold. Turning off the air conditioner and fan for about a half an hour, Becoming hot again. This has continued on and has not stopped. Extremely bad migraines as well since waking and did not let up at all. Sensitive to noise, light and sounds.
2.	The same feeling in my throat upon waking, I drank water to cool off and see if this would stop. And it didn&rsquo;t.
3.	My face was tingling all over as well.
4.	Moderately nauseous upon standing up or sitting down. The nausea had continued all day. Had a special K cereal bar to ease this up in the morning. Having only relief from it less than an hour.
5.	Tried eat cereal for lunch and discovered unable to eat it at all. The taste of it was making me sicker.
6.	Took two 500 mg acetaminophen at 0700, relief was only slight and the head aches returned less than two hours.
7.	Overall neck pain eased up and other arthritic symptoms did as well. I could definitley tell a difference, However the head ache did not.


8.	Decided to take a dosage during the morning at 1000 hrs. To avoid loss of bowel control in my sleep. Within about two hours, felt it working through my system. Same effects I mentioned as before. Severe headaches and Nausea all day. And of course unbearable hot &amp; cold feelings again thinking that these should eventually pass as I become used to it.
9.	Laid down from 1400 to 1700 to alleviate the symptoms. Awoke from the nap and tried to eat dinner. One bite made me sick to my stomach. Headaches still there. 
10.	Overall, felt the same until bedtime as I did all day. Will give it one more try tomorrow morning.
Did not take any meds except Atorvastatin, and two acetaminophen.

Lexapro (10mg) over the past 8-9 yrs has been a lifesafer, as any of my friends will readily corroborate. If I go off for a few days (refill issues), they can tell! However since my mother died 3 yrs ago and ended my 13-year role as caregiver, I have sunk into a very narrow life, with few interests, a morbid aversion to human interaction, and often a complete inability to get out of bed and tend to the simple basics, like eating, showering, and dressing.

It&#039;s better for me than Viibryd (the medicine it most closely resembles), but I&#039;m still in a state of deep dysfunction.  On the positive side, the side effects have been minimal, the most prominent being some decrease in sexual desire and sexual pleasure.  (Not really an issue for me though since my anxiety and depression pretty much have a corner on that non-existent aspect of my life).  Also, even with my decent insurance, and Takeda&#039;s &quot;discount card,&quot; the cost for a month&#039;s supply of 30mg a day (the dose I&#039;m taking) is about $300.

I would safely say that the Implanon did not cause the weight gain, that time did. I do experience breast tenderness around the time of my menstrual period (which by the way is regular.. 3-5 days a month) and that only lasts as long as the menstrual cycle itself.

Had some bad mood swings the first month and have had a minimal amount of weight gain over 6 months (3-5 lbs). Have had worse cramping than I used to have.

I only wash my face once every 3 days to help prevent over drying and every night I remove my makeup, use a micellar water, apply a layer of Differin, and then an oil mixture to moisturize. I&#039;ve found that facial oil rather than a moisturizer increases the effectiveness of Differin, it almost seals it close to the skin at night. Wouldn&#039;t recommend Differin to everyone, but it worked wonders for me. Its all about patience and dedication.""",9,8-Nov-17,4

I assume it will stop in a couple months once my body adjusts, but was just wondering if anyone had any knowledge if this was normal.

This birth control hasn&#039;t helped with my acne at all, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s necessarily worse which is a good thing. I&#039;ll be going on accutane soon for that anyways.

Zoloft though in general has helped incredibly within the last three months -- my boyfriend and I don&#039;t fight, I don&#039;t get snappy on people, and I feel so much better about going out and doing things.

But recently I had my period for about 4 days, it stopped for a couple days, and now I&#039;m spotting. But, other than that I have had no problems at all. I love my birth control.

Not bad at all. For the Liletta, the strings were cut too short. I had a few days of spotting after insertion, but then I was back to normal. The pro is that Liletta was very effective in avoiding pregnancy and it got rid of my period. The con is that I experienced frequent painful headaches, cramping before my periods (which is new to me), painful sex from sharp ovary pain and dryness, low libido, acne, weight gain, and serious bloating. For removal, I had to get my cervix dilated because the strings curled up inside. Two months have passed and now I&#039;m 15lbs down &amp; symptoms have faded""",4,7-Oct-17,2

After being on it a while, I noticed that I got increasingly violent. I would get angry over the tiniest things. My periods are a lot lighter and not as painful.

When I spoke to my GP about this, he made the connection between Lyrica and my general malaise, noting that it is also used for anxiety, which I did not have. After that, we worked to wean the dosage down and I stopped taking it after a few weeks.

Having never suffered from breakouts on my back, this caused a whole new form of embarrassment, and just in time for summer! I suffered through the pack then asked to go back to Gianvi. 2 weeks later my skin and back are clearing up beautifully.

I HAVE experienced two seizures thought to be caused by Tramadol while I was titrating upward on the drug, but have had no problems since.  I have tried titrating off of Tramadol twice and in both instances experienced moderate withdrawal symptoms of the opiate type almost immediately.

I&#039;m a very active person and I do what wait I eat, especially since I am a cardiac nurse. Also make sure you NEVER miss a day of the medication. My side effects would be vertigo and shooting nerve pains in my head. I just upped my dosage to 150mg hoping it will increase my energy and help with weight loss.

I started to slowly be able to get out of bed in the night (third shift) and be excited to go to work and engage people. Sadly, over time the anxiety seemed to have gotten worse. My sleeping also went back to its normal habits. They upped it to 40mg to no avail. Now I&#039;m off cold turkey and the depression is hitting harder than it has ever. Wish I could get back on it.

I notice some slight change in mood. I can get irritated easy but I notice it and don&#039;t let it bother me. The only thing that bothers me is pretty much having another period mid cycle, wasn&#039;t really light spotting either.

I have experienced some serious PMS symptoms since I&#039;ve been on the ring (not every time but I think it&#039;s getting more frequent) like irritability and general emotionalness, some pretty severe cramps (which I rarely got before), and tiredness. Recently, I had a super heavy flow during my period plus cramps. I&#039;ve been getting some headaches and back pain too but I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s because of the ring.

I have in the past felt shamed of my condition as I thought I was unique and alone and somewhat embarrassed to try to explain my irrational feelings and thoughts, which I have learned since that they are entirely &quot;made up&quot; and thoughts lead to feelings that lead to behaviors all of which can be undone with the help of medicine, therapy, relaxation techniques, journaling, diet, exercise and not being afraid to open up about your anxiety.

If you&#039;re on a high dose and for example your lips are dry enough that its affecting your daily life, just lower your dose! Easy as that.

Then about a year after I had it, my periods started lasting two weeks at a time, then it stopped for a couple months then I started getting them twice a month.

My period came every 31 days or so (which was how it was before birth control) for 6 months. After six months on being on Trinessa my period regulated to exactly every 28 days. Triness has definitely made my period cramps lighter, which is great. I just take two Aleve before and during my period and I feel better. I have not gained any weight from it.

I have gained 15 pounds and it&#039;s extremely noticable. All I crave is junk food. I&#039;m way more irritable. And all the time. The week before my period is horrible. I often get bad PMS before my period. But the pill amplified it. It&#039;s even effected my sex drive, which is now non existent. The pill works for pregnancy prevention. But I would not recommend taking it.""",1,16-Aug-17,0

I asked my doctor about the Nuvaring. If it didn&#039;t help, I would go through with the surgery. I was constantly in pain and I was fed up with it. I read the information and started my dose. After 24 hours, I felt wonderful. In four years, I haven&#039;t had a cyst. Lighter, shorter periods, no weight gain, less acne, healthier skin and hair, and very little PMS.

I have not gained weight or had any significant side effects. It made my period A LOT lighter (went from seven days with heavy bleeding to four days of just spotting), and the only downside I can find with it are the cost ($78).

I was so shocked at how quick it took and how little it hurt, I really was expecting to be in a lot of pain.....now 2-3 hrs later I&#039;ve got no bleeding and a bit of a dull ache like a period pain.

I reduced back down to 37 mg and felt pretty good for a couple of months, but started to notice trouble responding to people around me.  It felt like being in a daze that took some effort to break.  I also started to feel out of sorts and frenzied.  I decided to stop the medicine a few weeks ago and feel 100% better.  No more confusion or anxiety!

In conjunction with the meds, I have continued to do depth psychology and psycho-spritual work which I think have also contributed to how well I feel.  People notice how bright I appear.

Most importantly to me, while I did feel the usual significant euphoria associated with most prescription narcotics, it was not overwhelming and no dizziness or disorientation accompanied it.

My sex drive seemed to increase and to be very honest, I no longer had any use for lubricant other than what my body produced. However, after about a year and a half, a horrible smell started and my periods were mostly just intense discharge and sometimes it would last for a couple weeks.

Firstly, I was terrified of weight gain. I already struggle to keep my weight low and suffer from a slow metabolism. I have to workout and eat healthily regularly. I have gained no weight.

There have been months when I haven&#039;t had a period at all, and others when I&#039;ve had a period as well as breakthrough bleeding mid-month. I&#039;m switching to a pill with a little bit more estrogen in it to see if that will regulate my period better.

I haven&#039;t missed any pills, and I take them within two hours of one another everyday. I was initially really worried about nausea being an issue, so I take them at night - but I&#039;ve had no problems.

So, I got up, cleaned myself up and I was actually bleeding a whole lot. But my doctor gave me a pad and some wipes. My legs were so weak after that. 
When I left, I instantly became dizzy and a little nauseated. But the cramps got worse and then when I was home, they weren&rsquo;t as bad. I also took an extremely hot bath. I&rsquo;m not bleeding right now but I am still crampy.""",5,17-Oct-17,0

But on the third month, I started to have brown spotting every day, and the spotting became a full blown period  with the worst cramping I had ever experienced, even though I skipped placebo week and continued the full strength pills continuously.  My doctor did not prescribe this as a method of birth control, as I am in infertile. The doctor prescribed it as  hormone replacement. As far as acne, my skin has always been clear and I have not noted any changes.  I have noticed that I am hungrier more often but I am able to control how much I eat without too much of a problem. I get random cravings but I don&#039;t exaggerate and pig out either. I do feel bloated, I feel that my stomach looks bigger, and overall I feel fatter, however the number on the scale has not changed so I cannot say I have gained weight. Libido has definitely decreased, and natural lubrication is just out the window. As far as sex goes, I think about it and seek it a whole lot less, and find it harder to become aroused. I did notice that I became more sensitive to stupid things that never bothered me before, and I cry by myself almost every day about little things and then get over it quickly. I just don&#039;t know what kind of damage I may be causing in my relationship with my husband. I don&#039;t know how I feel about this pill, and I cannot say that it was successful because it prevented pregnancy because that&#039;s not the reason why am taking it in the first place.

After birth control, I had finally become regular. About a year ago I decided to start birth control again because I was becoming more sexually active.

This way I could see how my body reacted to this form of contraception for 1 month but it would be easier to come off it if I didn&#039;t get on very well.

My dermatologist was so hesitant to prescribe me oral antibiotics (which is understandable because of antibiotic resistance) and prescribed me birth control instead (Alesse 28). This caused my acne to worsen and I was not happy at all. Anyhow, I&#039;m off that now and on Doxy and tretinoin cream. I have had no side effects so far. Happy.""",9,20-Apr-13,12
172199,Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""Been on clonazepam for a while. It is not as effective for me as lorazepam since most of my anxiety is due to severe, treatment resistant OCD however it&#039;s still effective in reducing debilitating anxiety. It has a longer half life than lorazepam and xanax but it&#039;s slower to take affect. My doctor combines this with hydroxyzine for panic attacks and it works quite well. I recommend this benzodiazepine over other since xanax has an extremely high chance of dependency, and over lorazepam because its just recently been discovered that lorazepam can cause dementia.""",8,9-Nov-17,2

So I called my doctor and she switched me to 150MG. I thought to myself &quot;maybe the dosage was just low&quot;. Again the medication worked right away, but again the medication for some reason only lasted about two weeks. I went back to my doctor and she switched me to Prozac and so far it has worked pretty well. The symptoms I had with bupropion was nausea, diarrhea, and drowsiness.

The only con for me is towards the end of the 3 years, I get very emotional and depressed.  For about 3 months,  everything pisses me off, and /or makes me cry. Prior to implanon,  I have tries birth control pills, the patch, the ring, and the IUD.

I did gain some weight, but only because this pill increased my appetite.  I still workout six days a week and do not feel sluggish.  Gianvi totally cleared my skin except for the occasional pimple.

It helps calm me down to the point where I am not scared all the time. It sometimes takes a little while to work, but it&#039;s worth it. The only side effects I get are the &quot;spacey&quot; feeling in my head, and my vision is a little messed up.

After consulting with my doctor I may increase the dosage. Side effects: irregular bowel movements (resolved), excessive gas, sleepiness, tense/tight muscles and less intense orgasms.

A couple of months later I went to visit my psychiatrist on my regular visit and I explained the buspar and dosage I was told. She absolutely disagreed with my GP&#039;s dosage and informed me I should take this drug consistently 3x a day and not just as needed since this needs to build in your system to be effective.

Cons: getting hormonal acne (I have never had acne growing up until now at 23...) , random periods that you can&rsquo;t predict (even at 9 months it will come for 3 weeks even and go away for a long time- it&rsquo;s annoying), expensive

I wake up and feel like I&#039;m going to vomit in the mornings, but after I am up and eat, it goes away.  I&#039;ve actually lost my appetite and lost weight just in the 2 weeks of having it.  So far I love it! Hopefully I don&#039;t have any of the side effects like acne.  I recommend this to anyone!""",8,13-Feb-12,1

I was prescribed Yaz after none of the topical medications worked, for example, Tazorac, in both the gel and cream form. It does take a while to see the full effect. I noticed after 2 months the shine that I always had on my face went away, and slowly, over a course of about 9 months my skin was completely clear. It was a miracle, to say the least. My dermatologist kept me on the Tazorac just as a caution, but I know it was the Yaz that truly cleared my skin up. I highly recommend Yaz as long as you are in good health to use it (don&#039;t smoke or anything) and want to see a real change in your skin.""",10,26-Aug-10,25

I have 2 young kids so being tired/lazy is not really an option. I was never like this and I was never not in the mood for sex. I also get a little dryness. On a good note, I do have short periods. The first month it was really light the second month was kind of heavy but short so I&#039;m waiting to see how this third month goes. If nothing changes far as tiredness and not wanting sex, I&#039;ll switch.

Nothing was working and I was waking up in the morning every day with panic attacks. My GP recommended I go to a Psych, which I did for first time in my life. He changed me to long acting Xanex XR   Pristiq. Both have been massively better and Pristiq could be a game changer. The side effects I had adjusting to SSRIs were very very bad but getting on Pristiq has been very easy. Only a headache for 2 days. I recommend people try this.

I am so glad that I finally went to my G.P for help. I know now that I can cope with my thoughts/life. Nothing has really changed practically but I now have a positive outlook. I can cope! Friends and family can see the difference and I am no longer suicidal. I don&#039;t mind the side effect of yawning plus I can still drink but don&#039;t crave it as much.

Although I came across a few side effects - redness, dryness, peeling of skin - this cream completely eliminated most of my acne. I particularly found it astonishing that over the space of a few months my Cysts had decreased - in size -dramatically. They&#039;d shrink and leak until they vanish usually not leaving any scars, only marks - which will fade over a period of time. When my skin was feeling painful due to the side effects - stinging at night - I&#039;d stop using duac for a couple of days and moisturise up.

My acne wasn&#039;t even close to being this bad ever not even when I was going through middle or high school. I have gained some weight but not much. The biggest issue I have with this birth control is the non-stop random bleeding the lasts for months and the horrible cramps.

I thought &quot;Hey why not&quot; and took them. Well, second month was the worst. Gained probably 10lbs because I was constantly hungry. Became lethargic and it made me more depressed. That went away in the third month. Then the acne started. As someone who was on accutane and had relatively pimple-less skin, this pill brought up old wounds. Turns out this pill which is often persrcibed to TREAT acne, is one of the worst BC that causes acne. My skin is now 10x more oily and i have painful zits on my cheeks, chin and lips.

Lots of acne, dry skin, swollen lymph node, anxiety, depression, trouble sleeping, hopelessness. My doctor said that my swollen lymph node is associated with the liver. My acupuncturist said she thought I had liver congestion. I researched excess copper in the body. ALL. MY. SYMPTOMS. Had it removed within 2 days. Felt immediately better.

I feel normal again and my mood is more positive and I laugh/am happy more even in this tough economic time! No major side effects.

I also take Valium and Klonopin for my anxiety so I&#039;m not sure if those might mask any increased anxiety, but I have to say, I noticed a difference the first day.

- It&#039;s nice to be able to be spontaneous.

-I&#039;ve had some spotting off and on since I got the Nexplanon. It&#039;s more annoying than anything else. But it is REALLY annoying.""",8,3-Jun-17,1

I have gained 15 pounds and it&#039;s extremely noticable. All I crave is junk food. I&#039;m way more irritable. And all the time. The week before my period is horrible.

My second one caused me nothing but trouble...periods for 10 days with spotting / random days in between; stomach cramps all the way through the month; sex was painful for both my partner and I, and I&#039;d coil up in agony afterwards and would bleed pretty much every time.

It was light in volume, but lasted for almost 10 days. It was odd to say the least, but not as bad as I had been told it would be.
I have really enjoyed the lighter hormone load: I had previously used the pill, which made me gain a bit of weight and also lowered my libido to non-existent (I guess the birth control was two-fold in that respect). This, so far, has been much better.""",10,10-Nov-16,2

I became completely depressed on this medication, but blamed that on the fact that I just moved 1,000 miles from home and I was homesick. Then I started to realize that there was a pattern. I&#039;d get extremely anxious and depressed for a few days and then it would subside (somewhat) for a week or two. It got to the point where my anxiety was so bad I could barely breathe and making it through a day seemed impossible. I talked to my gynecologist and had my pill changed.

Now I have very very few bumps and also the scars left behind from old bumps is also beginning to clear up and lighten my complexion for a more even tone. The only downfall is the stinging that occurs sometimes along with minimal peeling but other than that it gets the job done and I&#039;m pleased with what I&#039;m seeing thus far.

The nausea was awful the first two weeks and dizziness lasted about a week with me. I am pretty sensitive to medications however. I have been on Cymbalta for almost two years- at a high dose (90mgs). I do find I am hot and sweaty (at times), I need a lot of sleep and have put on weight, (though HRT could have caused this).

Over the first few days I had a breakout with the acne that had been under my skin, after they cleared up, I had a bit of drying (still do) but nothing too bad!

I liked the idea of the IUD because I didn&#039;t have to remember to take it, it was there for three years, it was the most effective, and because there was an option to have an IUD without hormones. I struggle with depression and anxiety and I was afraid that hormonal birth control would only make matters worse. However, because of all of the terrible period stories I had heard about it, at the last minute I had my OBGYN switch to Skyla. The insertion did not take long at all and amid horror stories, the pain wasn&#039;t unbearable. It didn&#039;t feel great, but it was well worth it. If the fear of insertion is what drives you away from this option, don&#039;t let that happen! Before my IUD my periods were like clockwork, every four weeks, five days, no cramps- perfect. Afterward, I still don&#039;t get cramps, some periods have been really light, but I have had a period that was over a week late and one that was two weeks long. This is to be expected in the first few months. I do not believe that it has had any influence on my depression/anxiety, at least not monumental. I haven&#039;t gained weight, lost my sex drive or any other negative symptoms. My partner has finished inside of me multiple times and nothing has happened. Also, he cannot feel the strings.

Since being on this pill, my sex drive is through the roof (which my husband is so thrilled with), I don&#039;t have emotional highs/lows (and it may even be blunting my affect bc I don&#039;t really get sad at all anymore), and my skin looks great.

The cramps were painful to the point where it was debilitating but taking painkillers helped a lot. Between spotting and periods I was bleeding almost nonstop first few weeks. The IUD made my periods longer and heavier (went from 5 to 8 days) and I became extremely susceptible to bacterial vaginosis, which has recurred  continuously (and isvery costly to treat).

2. Sex drive. Mine had been non-existent since I went on Nexplanon in September. Now, stronger than ever. That might be a downside though, now that I think about it.
3. Skin- no acne!
4. Predictable cycle. (On Nexplanon, I never knew when I was going to menstruate, which was about 90% of the time). Now, a non issue.

123748,Skyla,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had the Skyla IUD for 2yrs now and it&#039;s been a fantastic experience. I will admit the insertion was very painful. I took 600mg of advil about an hour beforehand and it was still very painful (an 8.5 out of 10 pain wise). The rest of the day I had to stay home because the cramps would come in waves and were severe. After 2-3 days the pain was gone, but I did have bleeding/spotting for about 1-2 months afterward. However, I was on depo provera prior to the IUD and it caused my uterine lining to really thicken up, so there&#039;s no telling whether the bleeding was from the IUD or from the depo. Since then my periods come every 2 months or so, and only last about 3-4 days, and I&#039;ve never once worried about being pregnant. Highly recommend!""",10,10-Jan-17,4

He said for some people it may take up to 2 months to see any kind of result. It was working for me within a week. It is true, if taken in the morning on an empty stomach it does cause nausea.

I tried Lo-Estrin24, which caused me to spot and so my doctor thought I needed something a little stronger, so she prescribed me this. Since I have been on it, my mom and I got in a huge fight causing us not to talk for 2 weeks, I isolated my friends and got emotionally attached to a guy, which never happens and I have been eating like crazy.

For two months I am period free then about mid way through the third month I start spotting until I start my new pack. This is a huge improvement to what I&#039;m used to (used to be heavy flow and all the time) and it&#039;s given me a new found sense of freedom.

My childhood was great and I could never figure out why I struggled with depression, low self-esteem, racing thoughts, etc.  I&#039;ve been to counseling at various times and tried therapy including CBT.  While these have been helpful to a degree, I never seemed to be able to shake the feeling of angst, gloomy thoughts, etc.  I know it is still very early but I really feel great.

I have had bad acne for the past 10+ years, so when I first started taking Apri and the acne subsided I was thrilled. I like having regular, track-able periods, but I suppose you&#039;d have that with any birth control. The downside is the absolutely AWFUL mood swings, and I mean awful. I&#039;m typically a very happy, joke-y person, but while on this medication I&#039;ve noticed that I can get into funks of terrible irritability and sadness for no reason.

So I called the doctor and they said to switch to taking the pill at night. I take the pill as close to 10pm as possible and I haven&#039;t had anymore spotting or nausea.

It did make me nauseated but it says to take it on a full stomach which I took on an empty stomach. After I followed the directions I didn&#039;t have any more issues.

It is the only other thing besides daily antibiotics (doxycycline) that have controlled my acne. I tried Sprintec prior to this and it did nothing for my acne. Short term, I have had no side effects from Loryna. No weight gain, no extreme mood swings, nothing. My only complaint and reason for considering switching is that after taking this long term, I recently developed spider veins on my thighs. I have NEVER had such a thing so it was very concerning as I am only 25 and in very good health, and as I know there are increased risks for DVT while taking this drug. Recently the areas on my thigh where the spider veins developed have become somewhat painful at work (as I stand all day). I attribute the development of the spider veins directly to Loryna as this is only medication I have taken the past couple years. It is such a shame because I absolutely love what it has done for my skin (flawless even during the time around my period), but the veins cause a large concern for me so I am heavily considering switching. 
Overall, I love Loryna for the shorter term, however if you plan to be on it for a few years, it may be concerning.

I got my period twice a month and broke out twice a month. Periods were light with light cramps (compared to when I wasn&#039;t on birth control and had severe cramps).

My skin is no longer oily and I will get the occasional, non-inflamed pimple, but that is it! The only side effects I had were dry skin, dry lips, and occasional eczema on top of my hands (which was completely fixed by Aquaphor).  I was completely clear on Accutane after 2 months so the remaining 4 months was a breeze.  I had acne on my chest and back and since then I have had NOTHING on my chest and back, ever.  This medicine really, really works, and its the only thing out there that worked for me after trying just about everything.

If you do not see results within a week or two, do not stop applying bezaclin! The first 6-8 weeks may be rough but it really does clear up your skin. And my scars have faded. Do not over apply the medicine, it can cause over dryness of the face and excessive peeling. Hope benzaclin will help you beat acne like it helped me!""",9,27-May-15,31

During the first 3-4 months, my period was a bit erratic. It would last about 6-7 days and it would sometimes come once a month, sometimes more or less. It was much lighter than my natural periods. I took naproxen which would stop the bleeding most of the time. However after about six months my period has basically stopped. Occasionally I have an hour or so of spotting, and rarely I might have a few days in a row. One liner a day is always enough for the bleeding now.

I spotted occasionally on Camrese/Seasonique and yes, it&#039;s normal. But what my doctor told me and I have shared with friends experiencing the same is to stop your pill for 4 days. Allow the spotting to happen just as if it was a period, and then resume your pill. Be smart: use backup birth control those days. I found not always taking at the same time, within 2 hours, to be the cause of the spotting. I&#039;ve taken roughly 5 different pills over the past 10 years and Camrese worked best for me.

The symptoms included strong food cravings, increased appetite, always sleepy, lightheadness when standing up, breast augmentation, and most scariest stomach flutters.

I guess you can say that I am one of the luckier cases, I have not had my period since the insertion, nor have I had any bad side effects.

My periods have been 100% consistent and never had spotting between. It&#039;s so easy to remember changing once a week. The only negative thing for me was the first 4-5 months of use I had some irritated skin around the patch area. That has since resolved. I personally love this patch!""",6,16-Sep-16,5

I think a lot of dissatisfaction stems from the insecurity of not being able to have sex with the constant spotting and your partner potentially losing interest.

Finally, about 2 years ago, because of insurance change, I had to change psychiatrists. My new psychiatrist asked me if I had noticed side effects of weight gain and sexual dysfunction while on  Paxil. I had no idea my weight gain was related to Paxil. He weaned me off Paxil an on to Prozac. I lost 40 lbs in 6 mos without trying. Prozac works  just as well with my anxiety. Perhaps Paxil isn&#039;t the right choice for some people.""",1,27-May-17,20

The irritation caused itching and overall discomfort that in the very end of using it, even prevented me from being able to be intimate at all.

This is because it&#039;s a low estrogen pill. With Junel Fe I began to get acne all over my face - my jaw, cheeks, forehead, and chin. I would get up to 7 painful, embarrassing cystic lumps at a time and tons of zits that were oddly prone to leaving scars. I went from almost perfect skin to having adult acne!

My skin looks and feels fantastic! I still get an occasional zit here at there - I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s my fault as I&#039;m a toucher/picker/popper.

I noticed that overtime especially in the months I took it more often, the anxiety, the fast heart beats and confusion and strange muscle weakness were getting beyond tolerable.

I have noticed no major side effects, except from orthostatic hypotension and some headaches mainly at the beginning of the treatment.

I have been the same weight for 7 years and did not change my diet at all when taking Nexplanon, but it caused me to gain 10 pounds. I&#039;m breaking out worse than I did as a teenager because the Nexplanon is suppressing my body&#039;s ability to produce estrogen.

In the past year and a half I gained a good 50+ pounds. Yes I know the birth control didn&#039;t put the food in my mouth, but my fast metabolism was shot.

Do start at 5mg and slowly increase to 10 or 20mg. Ask you doctor to supplement with Buspar XL which counteracts most Lexapro side effects and further helps control anxiety and panic attacks.

It also gave me a horrible yeast infection. But that all went away and now I&#039;m back pretty much to my normal self. I will continue to keep using it""",7,28-Feb-16,2
157792,Accutane,Acne,"""I am 20 years old and have been suffering with acne since I was 14. I tried EVERY topical lotions, antibiotics, and face washes you can think of and nothing worked on my stubborn skin. I was terrified of going on Accutane because of some bad reviews I read about it. After talking with my dermatologist, I decided to give Accutane a shot. Best decision of my life!! I am currently almost done with my third month and my skin feels so smooth and looks amazing. I have so much more confidence in myself and can go out without worrying about my skin looking horrible. The only side effects I have gotten so far are dry skin and very dry lips (I carry Chapstick with me 24/7!). Other than that, all I can say is Accutane is truly a miracle.""",10,21-Jun-14,76
34703,Minocycline,Acne,"""Took it for six months and nothing cleared up and I had an especially red spot on my nose. I stopped taking the pill and the red spot went away. A few weeks later I started taking it again and the red spot came back. It doesn&#039;t work, only makes things worse""",1,13-Nov-15,3
186934,Benzaclin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and I have seen a LITTLE difference. But it does take time, and my doctor said it would get better before it gets worse. I&#039;m still holding out hope! My acne is pretty bad on my face. On my sides, my forehead, and my jawline. It is really bad. But I have faith in this product. Because my acne will not go away for anything! It is extremly stubborn. I&#039;m 18 so that may be part of the problem. I got this free with my isurance otherwise it would have be $380!! So, it better work. Only problem is it drys out my skin so I&#039;d recommend lotion!""",7,4-Oct-16,10
55761,Effexor,Depression,"""Effexor helped me see the reality of my life when I couldn&#039;t. I took Zoloft for a while (up to 150mg) and I felt more numb than &quot;happy&quot;. When I switched to a family doctor from my psychiatrist, they recommended Effexor XR; I&#039;ve been taking 75 mg a day for the past four months and my life has done a complete 180. No depression, very little anxiety, and I finally have CONFIDENCE. I have more friends now than I ever did, a wonderful new relationship that I could never have foreseen myself happening, and I&#039;m performing really well academically. Best decision of my life was taking Effexor- I can immediately see a difference in my thought processes when I forget to take it for two days at a time.""",10,28-Mar-15,52
149358,Mirena,Birth Control,"""While I enjoy not having a period and knowing I am protected from pregnancy without having to take a pill everyday I am having my Mirena removed Thursday. I have only had it 6.5 months and in that time I have had a constant dull back pain, uncontrollable acne and I have also gained 25 pounds. Mirena is just not for me.""",5,3-Nov-14,79
70074,Naprelan,Pain,"""I have suffered with right lower back pain for many years. I have taken Flexeril, Ibuprofen800, Percocet all of which dulled the pain or put me to sleep. My doctor put me on Naprelan and after two doses I am almost completely free of back pain.""",10,9-May-08,41
